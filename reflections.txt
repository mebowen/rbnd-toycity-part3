1. I really, really took my time with this project. I have been focusing a lot 
of my attention on supplementing my  Udacity coursework at this time. I have been 
reading David Black's "The Well-Grounded Rubyist," Flanagan and Matsumoto's 
"The Ruby Programming Language," and Zed Shaw's "Learning Ruby the Hard Way." 
Most of the code was pretty quick to write after I wrote product.rb, since 
there were so many similarities between files. I did spend quite a few hours
figuring out how to create my second new feature, though, which I will describe
below:

2. My biggest obstacle was adding a total_stock_value method in product.rb. 
I had to research the reduce method in order to accomplish this, so that took 
some time. Then, I got confused about the value this method was returning because
I didn't realize that puts walter.purchase(nanoblock) was indeed creating a 
second transaction. 

3. I added a list method for products and customers so that each can be printed in
alphabetical order. I added this method primarily because I wanted to figure out
how to sort objects in the context of a project like this. It was tricky but I am
glad that I figured it out. I also think it could be a useful feature for a program
like this. I can imagine my boss would want to see a list of customers at some point,
and I just added the feature to products for good measure. I added the
total_stock_value method because I felt that this would be a useful feature since a 
high return value indicates that we need to move more product off our shelves! 

4. I think generally, I still have a long way to go with feeling confident while
writing code. This project was a little better, but over all I have had this 
pervasive "WHAT AM I DOING????" mentality while working on projects so far. I think
reading supplementary materials as described above has helped me become more zen,
and it's definitely been nice to utilize Slack when I am really stuck. 


Thanks!
